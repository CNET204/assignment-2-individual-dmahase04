        <p>As a person who is growning up in a generation where electronic devices are heavily used for most things, I've been able to understand and learn about e-waste. It is actually very important thing because of how much e-waste is made each year,  only a small  bit gets recycled properly. These electronics are steadily effecting the environment in many negative ways. Even I can say I have e-waste around in my own home such as old phones, laptops, controllers and chargers. From seeing just the statics surrounding e-waste in Canada I am someone who does cares a lot about environmental sustainability, and I feel I should take some responsibilty to take action and advocate for more e-waste management practices. I think for my own role in this , I will definetly try to make better choices as a buyer, when looking for products. Additionally, this is even a chance to engage and talk  with people around me such as friends and family to let them know about the importance of responsible e-waste disposal which is supporting local initiatives that promote recycling and reuse. By doing this challenge and taking the time to understand more about these  practices, I believe we can contribute to a better future for the environment.
