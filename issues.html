        <p> Some factors that contribute to this issue is, When People continue to buy more electronic devices, e-Waste accumulates. For example, In 2010 around 224,000 tonnes of e-waste was created in Canada. Environment Canada is the controlling power managing e-waste although the government co-manages electronic waste with many organizations [15]. E-waste management has been divided into different levels of administration. The Federal, Provincial, and Municipal governments.</p>
        
        <p> Researchers believe that the growth of e-waste is related to consumer habits, as well as the increases in the number of households increases. Furthermore, rapid advancement in technologies significantly shortens the lifespan of electronics.</p>

        <p>Recycling e-waste has proven to be difficult for many reasons. In the Canada and United States alone, every person produces an estimated 20 kilograms of e-waste annually. According to the UN Environment Program (UNEP) report, 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste was produced in 2019. Only about a 20% of it was recycled. Electronic devices are complicated and made up of various components that must be broken down and recycled bit by bit. Most countries do not have the resources to handle that effectively.</p>
